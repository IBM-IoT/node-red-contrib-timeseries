	<p>This node takes data from the timeseries out node and transforms it to be inserted into the Internet of Things Foundation.</p>
	<p>This node is designed to be linked beetween the Timeseries In node and the ibmiotapp out node (You will also require a JSON node in between this and the ibmiotapp out node.  This will allow you to pull aggregated data out of Informix timeseries and push to the IBM IoT Foundation using the ibmiotapp out node.</p>
